## Creating a sample kubernetes environment with istio service mesh on AWS 
 

Microservices have become a popular architectural style for building cloud-native applications that are self-contained, independently deployable, resilient and quickly evolve. Additionally, Istio makes it easy to create a network of deployed services with load balancing, service-to-service authentication, monitoring.

Therefore, you may use this sample code as a starting point for your development environment. 



## TODO 
> There will be 2 approaches to install kubernetes;
- Installing kubernetes with kubeadm ( k8s services will be running as pod/deployment
- Installing kubernetes services as a system service ( kubernetes the hard way - systemctl service in linux )


> Second part will be deploying istio and creating a sample service mash.
